<h3><u>Tips for Getting Started:</u></h3>

    <li><b>Refresh Often</b> – Refresh often, especially whenever Neuroglancer is not responding like it should. Refresh not only reloads Neuroglancer, but also updates several other UI views. Use refresh just as freely as you would with a browser. It is harmless, almost instantaneous, and does not affect data or the state of your project in any way. It merely refreshes the user interface views including Neuroglancer viewers, browsers, tree views, table views, list views, and the SNR plot.</li>
    <br/><li><b>Align All</b> – Align All will always put the scale you are working on into a state where the cumulative affine is fully propogated through the image stack. Note that Align All means "align all images of the current scale". However, it is also possible to align all scales with refinement of the alignment at each level in just a single click. For that use the menu option: <b>Align > Align All Scales</b></li>
<br/><li><b>Rescaling</b> – It is possible to rescale your dataset with the menu option <b>Actions > Rescale...</b> <b><u>Caution</u> (!):</b> Rescaling causes loss of progress. It is equivalent to rewinding you project to immediately after importing images.</b></li>
