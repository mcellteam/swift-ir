Known Issues and TODO list

0@) compare old and new dms to create a better one (future proof dm, is it possible?)
        a) provide clean API for dm, for users/developers
        b) abstraction layers that encapulate
        c) GUI should use this API
1@) mir_coords and ng_coords not used in dm
2*) Implement manual strict mode in recipemaker
3@) clean up AFM-AIM confusion
4*) transfer/copy points from ref to tra in edit alignment gui
5*) allow manual entry of points
6*) allow manual entry of init afm/shi
6a*) show afm in gui
6b*) show point value of cursor location in edit alignment gui
7*@) preserve grid and manual settings in dm for use in gui
8) Fix Quit App look and feel in gui
9**TC) After changing scales, SNR graph has wrong scale on Y axis
10**TC) Fix update of JSON view for points
11) Result in manual mode has integer points (FIXED)
12**TC) SNR Result Preview in Edit Alignment does not update in manual mode
13) Store manual points in pixel units (FIXED)
14) Allow ignore cache at a specfic scale
15) Fix behavior of alignment settings in Edit Alignment Tab for user friendliness
16**,TB,BK) Gray out "Align" button if not propagated yet at finer scale, or remove progagate button altogether.
        a) remove the propagate button and add proper logic for automatic propagation
        b) logic based on date-stamp of results at next coarser scale
        c) if result at next coarser scale exists and is newer than at the current scale then auto-propagation will occur
           and Align button will be useable.  If not then Align button is grayed and auto-propagation does not occur.
        d) if swim settings have changed at coarser scale but alignemnent has not yet updated then, the Align button needs
           to be grayed out at all finer scales.  So need to check hash of results/swim-settings at coarser scale when setting
           state of Align button.
17) Allow user to set or auto-adjust font sizes in GUI (too small).
18) Newly created emstack should be selected in widget
19) Numerous race conditions in updates of GUI widgets
20) Cache hashes are set even when alignment fails -- need to delete hashed directories when alignment fails.

Test on TACC and Linux
