Name
----
iscale - Image scaler

Synopsis
--------
*iscale* -v +__scale__ -__contrast__ p=__outpath__ __infile__ ...

Description
-----------
The *iscale* command loads any number of input files, reduces their
sizes by a given scale factor in both x and y directions, and writes
the results to a common output folder.

The scale factor may be specified on the command line following a plus
sign. The default is 8.

An integer contrast may be specified to increase the image
contrast. This works in a slightly unusual way: If <__x__>
is the average intensity of the image, then a pixel with intensity _x_
is mapped to 128 + _c_ * (_x_ - <__x__>).

Normally, each output pixel is the average of a block of _scale_ x
_scale_ input pixels. If, however, one or more -v arguments are given,
the output is instead the | _x_ - <__x__> | noise in each block.

If an input file is /path/to/file.ext and the scale factor is
_n_, then the output file is /path/to/S__n__file.ext.

Exception: if ``p=__outpath__'' is specified on the command line, the
output file is outpath/S__n__file.ext.

**iscale** is primarily intended for grayscale images. It will run on
  RGB images as well, but contrast adjustment and variance measurement
  are not supported.
