Name
----
remod - Image combiner

Synopsis
--------
*remod* [options] -__span__ [-__skip__] imagefile1 imagefile2 ...

Description
-----------

Remod takes a stack of _n_ images, loads them all into memory, and
outputs a stack of _n_ ``gral'' images with names constructed by
replacing the three character suffix (plus the preceding period) by
``&#95;MDL.PNG''.

A ``gral'' image is the average of 2 __span__ + 1 consecutive images except
for the central __skip__ images. The _span_ *must* be specified
on the command line. The _skip_ *may* be given; it defaults to 1. Note
the asymmetry between _span_, which specifies the half-range, and
_skip_, which specifies the total number of central images to
skip. Typically, _skip_ will be odd.

The purpose of *remod* is to then align the central image to its
neighbors with *swim*.

Options
-------

**-e**:: Do ends. Normally, no output is generated for the first _span_ and last _span_ images. If **-e** is given, such output _is_ generated, but the _skip_ value is ignored for these outputs (only).

**-a**:: Adaptive mode. Normally, *remod* calculates a simple
   average. With **-a** given, it stretches the contrast of each
   individual output image.
