1) Sort Scales in Menu (Done: March 21st, 2020)
2) Copy Skip status to other scales?
     Optional. Might want to unskip at finer scale as alignement is refined.
3) Remember corresponding image zoom and relative position across scales
4) Show Status info:
     a) Progress while generating scales
     b) Progress while aligning
     c) Status of project:
        i)   Perhaps need project description/metadata field?
        ii)  Perhaps need flag to mark in-work status?
        iii) Done scales (meaning afm's for all base images)
        iv)  Next scale TBD (next finest scale with missing afm's)

5) Buttons for "Refine Affine" and "Apply Affine"
6) Button for remaking aligned images with nulled bias.
   a) store bias stats for given scale
   b) store bias function (as eval function string) in data model
7) Parameter for whitening factor
8) Parameter for wsf (swiftir window scaling factor)
   a) Whole stack
   b) custom value for a given problematic image
   


Wish List:

Some thoughts while working remotely from home on my Mac using X to eccles.
Mac on WiFi 5GHz 802.11n.  Ookla SpeedTest 70Mbps download, 6Mbps upload.
Likely useful when using alignem_swift.py via the 3DEM portal on TACC.

1) Jump to Frame # (Done: March 21st, 2020)
     Scrolling is a bit slow over X.  About 1 fps.
