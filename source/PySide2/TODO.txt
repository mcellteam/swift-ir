TODO Task list (add date when completed):

1) Sort Scales in Menu (Done: March 21st, 2020)
2) Copy Skip status to other scales? (Done: March 24th, 2020 ... New buttons to clear/copy)
     Optional. Might want to unskip at finer scale as alignement is refined.
3) Remember corresponding image zoom and relative position across scales
4) Show Status info:
     a) Progress while generating scales (Prototype created March 23rd, 2020, problems on Mac)
     b) Progress while aligning
     c) Status of project:
        i)   Perhaps need project description/metadata field?
        ii)  Perhaps need flag to mark in-work status?
        iii) Done scales (meaning afm's for all base images)
        iv)  Next scale TBD (next finest scale with missing afm's)

5) Buttons for "Refine Affine" and "Apply Affine" (Buttons Added March 24th, 2020)
6) Button for remaking aligned images with nulled bias.
   a) store bias stats for given scale
   b) store bias function (as eval function string) in data model
7) Parameter for whitening factor                    (Parameter Added March 24th, 2020)
8) Parameter for wsf (swiftir window scaling factor)  (Parameter Added March 24th, 2020)
   a) Whole stack
   b) custom value for a given problematic image
   

Wish List (add date when completed):

Some thoughts while working remotely from home on my Mac using X to eccles.
Mac on WiFi 5GHz 802.11n.  Ookla SpeedTest 70Mbps download, 6Mbps upload.
Likely useful when using alignem_swift.py via the 3DEM portal on TACC.

1) Jump to Frame #                            (Done: March 21st, 2020)
     Scrolling is a bit slow over X.  About 1 fps.


Bug Reports (add date when competed):

1) Unusual crashes due to "malloc" errors:

  These have happened while rapidly scrolling through the stack.

  Because they appear to be due to the Python interpreter crashing,
  there is very little debug information available.
  All of these crashes have happened on the older Macintosh.

2) Not generating all scales

  Sometimes the JSON file will contain layers for only the first scale,
  but no layers for any of the other scales. When this happens, generation
  of scales proceeds properly, but no scaled images are generated because
  the image stacks for the scales are empty. The key question here is: How
  does such a JSON file get created?

3) Changing roles generates additional panels

  The changing of roles does not seem to work properly in aligem.py.
  Adding a role ('x1') to the default roles ('ref', 'base', 'aligned') gives:
    'ref' 'base' 'aligned' 'ref' 'base' 'aligned' 'x1'
